Using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Plotly, Python APIs:

# WeatherPy

A series of scatter plots were created to showcase and describe the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Then, linear regression was run on each relationship, twice for each, for Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.

# VacationPy

Using the analysis from above, the Google Places API was used to determine ideal vacation spots based on an ideal criteria.

The locations were displayed on a heat map, which illustrates humidity.
